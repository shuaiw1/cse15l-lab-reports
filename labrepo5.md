title :Lab 6<br>
Hi, I'm working on lab6 and encountering a compile-time error. The program is supposed to perform operations on lists, but it's failing to compile. Here's a screenshot of the error I'm getting in my terminal.<br>
The error points to a syntax issue, but I can't seem to figure out exactly what's wrong.<br>

Hi! It looks like a syntax error. Could you check for missing semicolons or incorrect syntax in your Java file? These are common causes of compile-time errors in Java. Pay special attention to the lines where the error is indicated.<br>
