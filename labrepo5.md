title :Lab 3<br>
Hi, I'm working on lab3 and encountering a compile-time error. The program is supposed to perform operations on lists, but it's failing to compile. Here's a screenshot of the error I'm getting in my terminal.<br>
The error points to a syntax issue, but I can't seem to figure out exactly what's wrong.<br>

Hi! It looks like a syntax error. Could you check for missing semicolons or incorrect syntax in your Java file? These are common causes of compile-time errors in Java. Pay special attention to the lines where the error is indicated.<br>

Part2<br>
In this quarter, I discovered the power of terminal commands, which was something I had never used extensively before. Previously, I relied heavily on graphical interfaces for my computing tasks. However, through our lab exercises, I learned how terminal commands offer a level of precision and efficiency that GUIs often can't match. For instance, using commands like grep for searching within files or git for version control has significantly streamlined my workflow. This new skill has not only made me more proficient in managing and manipulating files but also deepened my understanding of the underlying processes in my computing environment.
